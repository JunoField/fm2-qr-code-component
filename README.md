## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - A build and test tool for common web dev technologies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Used to support the other dependencies
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - An extension for CSS adding additional features - not at all necessary for this project, but I like using it regardless.



### Continued development

This is my first attempt at mobile-first development. I will certainly be continuing this workflow, but much more practice and experience will be necessary.

### Useful resources

- [https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This was great with regards to centering the centre card on the screen.
